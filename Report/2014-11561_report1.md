# Report for Final Project 1

## Overall
* Period and execution time confugurations in `design.xml` are not modified.
* Average lap time is about **68 Seconds** (About **100 Seconds** decreased compared to Baseline).

## What I Did

### CC.cpp
* Target speed `read2` is set to `read2 / 100 + 230000`, which is **103km/h**.

### LK.cpp
* When `(rtU->read1 < 0.0) && (rtU->read1 < -10000.0)`, `rtDW->w3` is set to **2000.0**.
* When `(rtU->read1 > 0.0) && (rtU->read1 > 10000.0)`, `rtDW->w4` is set to **2000.0**.
* When `(rtU->read1 < 0.0) && (rtU->read1 >= -10000.0)`, `rtDW->w3` is set to `((rtU->read1) * (-1) / 7)`.
* When `(rtU->read1 > 0.0) && (rtU->read1 <= 10000.0)`, `rtDW->w4` is set to `(rtU->read1) / 7`.

## Why I Did So

### Steering Ratio
* Steering ratio is the ratio between the turn of the steering wheel and the turn of the wheels.
* If a steering ratio is high, it means that the steering wheel needs to be turned more in order to get the wheels turn.
* Original values for `w3` and `w4` were too large for high speeds. When a vehicle runs in a high speed, it becomes oversusceptible to steering ratio. That is, a slight turn of the steering wheel becomes significantly influential to the direction of the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to lessen the value of steering ratio to be compatible with higher speeds.

### Actual Numbers
* Higher the target speed, the better, but had difficulty controlling the steering wheel when it becomes higher than **103km/h**.
* Numbers **2000.0** and **7** (divisor) are determined by trial-and-error.
