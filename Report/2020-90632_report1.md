*Write down what you did and why you did it to get a higher speed from the baseline

0. In the baseline, to allocate a lot of resources to important functions later, modify the all of SWC to p=500 and e=50 
1. I slightly increased the target speed until the driving failed. Then, find the best steer value for the record.
2. Changing the SWC's parameters one by one, I observed that LK, SENSING and BRAKE affects the handling of direction. Increase the frequency of LK(p=125, e=25), SENSING(p=125, e=25) and BRAKE(p=125, e=25).
3. Follow the method of 1. to find the best target speed and steer value.
4. I observed that CC affects the stability of the speed. Increse the frequency of CC until don't meet the deadline. CC(p=125, e=25).
5. Slightly increased the target speed until the driving failed.

Result
target speed = 115km/h
steer value = 2000
CC(p=125, e=25), LK(p=125, e=25), SENSING(p=125, e=25), BRAKE(p=125, e=25), POWER(p=500, e=50), LOCAL(p=500, e=50)
