## Case #1
In `Job.cpp`, `Job::run_function()` is a function that executes the job. It reads data from `tagged_data` and writes data to `delayed_data`. I decided to place my `task_read_write_logger` right after the actual read or write operation occurs. There are 4 places: read and write both available (logger for each), read only available, write only available. You can see the positions in my `Jop.cpp`.

## Case #2
In `Executor.cpp`, as Case #1, I placed my `real_cyber_event_logger` right after the actual operation performed. For `RELEASED`, it is the place that `job->set_is_released` becomes true. For `STARTED` and `FINISHED`, they are the places that actual job execution does by `run_job->run_function()`, and `run_job->set_is_simulated` becomes true. Lastly for `FINISHED (DEADLINE MISS)`, the deadline missing check is performed before iterating Loop for running jobs in one hyper period. I put it there.

I found that a simple implementation can cause the logging time not to be ordered. `Logger::start_logging` solved this by not processing logs right after they come but saving 10 logs like buffer and printing one of those having minimum time. But I thought this method is vulnerable and giving counter examples is quite easy.

What I have observed is, a job has three logs, `RELEASED`, `STARTED`, and `FINISHED`. And the `RELEASED` time always precedes the others. That is, if a job `J` is released at time `t`, then for any jobs having the same tasks as `J`, the `RELEASED`, `STARTED`, and `FINISHED` time must be later or equal than `t`. So, I saved released time of all tasks (in our experiments, 6 tasks). Let the minimum of these saved released time be `t_min`. Because the time of any logs coming after that point must have larger or equal than `t_min`, we can print the buffered logs having smaller time than `t_min` in time-ordered sequence. I did it by priority_queue, and it works pretty well.
