The objective of this project is to make simulated car as fast as possible, without crash and deadline miss.
Mainly, I've modified files in two ways.

First, changing the parameter in CC and LK files.
Since I have to understand the role of each parameter, I simualted the torcs with my hand at first.
And then, I simulated the baseline code. From this process, I can figure out that direction change of the baseline code is really extreme. Because when I simulate with my hand, car does not change the direction in such extreme way.
Then, I can figure out that changing the direction of the car is affected by "rtDW->w3 = rtU->read1 * -1". It means that changing direction is implemented similar to mirror reflection. By changing '-1' to '-0.1', I can make my car to drive in more stable way.
Also, boundary condition for direction change is also modified because frequent change in direction with high speed may cause crash of the car. Furthermore, in order to make more stable driving, I figure out that "rtDW->w4 = rtU->read1" is related to cornering.
Since line keeping is implemented regarding the detection of angle between car and line of the lane. Therefore, by assigning smaller value than rtU->read1, such as rtU->read1 * 0.4, I thought I can make more stable driving especially when car goes into the corner.
In order to decrease the lap time, I have to increase the target speed of the car. However, target speed and direction change shows trade-off relation. It means that, higher speed requires smaller change in direction.
It is mainly because line keeping check, which is implemented in LK file, is modeled as periodic task. Therefore, if the target speed is faster, then car will move more distance during the same period, which may cause crash, making the lap time invalid.
Testing several times with different parameters, my final setting has target speed of 75km/h. Though I could make it more faster, I just set it as 75km/h since making it faster cause unstable driving at some point.

Second, changing execution time, period, and deadline of LK module. As mentioned above, line keeping module should check and change the direction more frequently in order to make car driving stable. However, considering deadline miss is crucial for it.
Considering this point, I modified the property of job related to LK module to have smaller execution time and period, so that line checking will be executed more frequently. Therefore, I can make simulated car to drive more stable.
Also, since I've changed execution time to 25 and period, deadline to 300, it also meets deadline condition and minimum utilization constraint mentioned.


By changing in above two ways, my simulated car has lap time between 1min 10sec ~ 1min 20sec.
