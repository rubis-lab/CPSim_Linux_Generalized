# Report for Final Project 2
> Authored by 2014-11561 MIN Sun Hong

## Overall
* Implemented logging functions will help the users in embarrassed situations such as car not moving.
* Detailed function-level explanations are written as comments in source files.

## Case 1: Creating `2014-11561_read_write.log`

### Generals
* Target tasks are LK and CC, which are car movement related tasks.
* Target tasks can be set by modifying `log_task` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/settings.txt`.

### `Logger.h` and `Logger.cpp` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Engine/`
* `set_rw_log_info` is created to write header of `2014-11561_read_write.log`. It is called in the constructor `Loggger()`.
* `tagged_data_logger` and `delayed_data_logger` are created to handle `TaggedData` and `DelayedData`, respectively. They need to be handled separately since their **DATA LENGTH** and type of **READ/WRITE** differ. TaggedData has **DATA LENGTH** of **7** Bytes and is **READ** typed. DelayedData has **DATA LENGTH** of **5** Bytes and is **WRITE** typed.
* `_2014_11561_task_read_write_logger` appends all previosuly written log information and writes an output file `2014-11561_read_write.log` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Log/`.

### `Job.cpp` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Engine/`
* Inside `run_function`, the logger is only  interested in the case where `get_is_read` and `get_is_write` are both true.
* If `TaggedData` typed `tagged_data` is not `empty`, and if the name of the current task matches `utils::log_task`, which is set by modifying `log_task` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/settings.txt`, logger should be called.
* Otherwise, logger should deal with `DelayedData` typed `delayed_data`. Same as above, if the name of the current task matches `utils::log_task`, logger should be called.

### Results
* `2014-11561_read_write.log` is written in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Log/`.
* Below represents first few lines of the output file.

| [ TASK NAME ] | [ TIME ] | [ READ/WRITE ] | [DATA LENGTH] | [RAW DATA] |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| LK | 50 | WRITE | 5 | 0x32 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 |
| LK | 0 | READ | 7 | 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 |
| LK | 550 | WRITE | 5 | 0x226 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 |
| LK | 500 | READ | 7 | 0x1f4 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 |
| LK | 1050 | WRITE | 5 | 0x41a 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 |

* It is noticeable that the car is not moving since all the data except the first field, which is `data_time`, are zero.

## Case 2: Creating `2014_11561_event.log`

### Generals
* There are four types of events: `RELEASED`, `FINISHED`, `STARTED`, and `FINISHED (DEADLINE MISS)`.
* Order of events that happened in same time is ignored.

### `Logger.h` and `Logger.cpp` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Engine/`
* `struct EventUnit` is defined in `Logger.h` to hold an event log with all necessary information.
* `std::vector<EventUnit>` typed `m_event_buffer` is defined to hold event logs of `EventUnit` type.
* `set_event_log_info` is created to write header of `2014-11561_event.log`. It is called in the constructor `Logger()`.
* `_2014_11561_real_cyber_event_logger` writes `2014-11561_event.log` to `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Log/`. Arguments `long long time`, `int job_id`, and `std::string event_type` are coalesced into `EventUnit` type and is `push_back`ed to `m_event_buffer`. `utils::mtx_data_log` is used for concurrency control during write. As in `start_logging` of `Logger.cpp`, it only writes out when `m_event_buffer`'s size is bigger than 10.

### `Executor.cpp` in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Engine/`
* `run_simulation` is in charge of series of events, so `_2014_11561_real_cyber_event_logger` is called inside this function, under below circumstances.
* If `job->get_actual_start_time() < 0` or `job->get_actual_finish_time() > job->get_actual_deadline()`, it means that `DEADLINE MISS` event has occurred.
* There are conditions when `job->set_is_released(true)`. This means that `RELEASED` event has occurred.
* There are conditions when `job->set_is_simulated(true)`. This means that `STARTED` and `FINISHED` (only after `run_function`) events have occurred.

### Results
* `2014-11561_event.log` is written in `CPSim_Linux_Generalized/Log/`.
* Below represents first few lines of the output file.

| [ TIME ] | [ JOB ID ] | [ EVENT TYPE ] |
|:--- |:--- |:---|
| 0 | J0 | RELEASED |
| 0 | J2 | RELEASED |
| 0 | J3 | RELEASED |
| 0 | J4 | RELEASED |
| 0 | J5 | RELEASED |
| 0 | J0 | STARTED |
| 0 | J1 | RELEASED |
| 50 | J0 | FINISHED |
