## Report 1

### Modified Files
CC.cpp: I have increased the max target speed to 100km/h
LK.cpp: I have changed the max steering value to 5000
design.xml: I have changed the execution time of CC, POWER, BRAKE, LOCAL, SENSING to 50. Then, I changed the execution time of LK to 30, and its period to 150.

### Explanation
When I changed the target speed to 100, the vehicle kept driving to the left or right and bumped into the wall. Therefore, I tried to change the maximum steering value to 5000, but it still did not changed the result. Then, I noticed that when I reduced the deadline of LK, the whole steering problem have vanished. I realized that I must reduce the deadline of LK in order to increase the speed of the car.

The problem was that there were constraints I needed to follow and I need to avoid dealine miss. First, I knew that this program is following a rate monotonic scheduling policy, and all tasks are periodic. Therefore, I used the utilization bound formula to check the guarantee the deadlines of periodic jobs. Since there are 6 jobs, the total sum of utilization must be below 0.743. So then I first tried to reduce the utilization of SENSING, BRAKE, POWER, and LOCAL tasks to the minimum, which is 0.1 since they have a period of 500. I reduced the execution time to 50. Because all tasks except for LK have utilization of 0.1, I still have 0.234 utilization left for LK. I tried to make LK have a utilization of 0.2 with small period without any miss on constraints. Therefore, I reduced the period of LK to 150 with execution time of 30. 

As a result, the car was able to move at a constant speed of 100km/h without having weird steering issues. 

### Output
The final best lap time was 56.6 seconds. I have reduced about 2 minutes from the baseline lap time.
