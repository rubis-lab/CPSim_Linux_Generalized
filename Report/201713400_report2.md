#Computer Modeling Final Project2 Report

The objective of this project is to understand CPSIM in lower level.
From the first project, I could learn the high-level feature of CPSIM by controlling parameters to make car faster.
Since the goal of this project is to implement logging function for 2 cases, I have to understand internal behavior of pre-implemented functions inside the library.
I'll explain in details below regarding each cases.

##Case1.
It mainly focus to implement logging function that can keep track of the change in LK and CC modules. 
Since it should detect the 'read' and 'write' executed inside the program, it is important to determine when each read/write is done inside the program.
Mutex is used to prevent data race condition, and functionality is implemented inside those block.
task_read_write_logger function just takes task_name, which is formmated string of each task, and write it.
To see the generating process of task_name, run_function at the job.cpp file is useful.
I've used the pre-implemented structure of the function, since it already distinguish job with read/write, read, and write respectively.
If logging is needed, I control teh data size and also made string, which is taken as parameter(task_name) for task_read_write_logger function.
This process is similarly implemented for each read and write tasks.

##Case2.
It mainly focus to implement logging function for all 6 modules, implemented inside CPSim library, such as LK, CC, BRAKE, POWER.
real_cyber_event_logger function takes time, job id, and event type as parameters, and regarding the event type, it determines the appropriate actions.
Since there are 6 modules in total, there are vectors(arrays) of 6 element with respect to event type, started job, finished job, and released job.
run_simulation function inside the executor.cpp file gives me a big picture of implementation.
I could see the line "std::cout << "DEALINE MISS IN REAL CYBER SYSTEM" << std::endl;", and by inspecting this code, I could firmly believe that it will be enough to call real_cyber_event_logger function with appropriate parameter.
After that, I medidated through the code to find when will cause finish, release, and start event, and then insert the function call with appropriate parameters at appropriate section.
One of the main problem I faced is to how to process those distinguised information of each job with appropriate carrier, namely data structure, which are implemented using vector-like array, mentioned above.
Writing to log file is implemented inside the update function. It is similar to the function implemented for case1.
