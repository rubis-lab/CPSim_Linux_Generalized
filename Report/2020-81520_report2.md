# Report 2 Erik Bock

This report contains information about how the loggers were implemented.

## Case 1

The first logging function is called "student_2020_81520_task_read_write_logger" and is implemented in Logger.cpp. It takes a task name, and either a TaggedData or DelayedData (Although it could take both at the same time) as parameters. The function begins by determining if the logfile has been set-up for the current run. If the answer is no, it cleans the file and adds the header. If the answer is yes, then it moves on without action. Next the task name parameter is compared to the task name that has been set in settings, since only this task should be logged. If they are not the same the function takes no further action. If they are the same however the function opens the log file and formats/writes the data from the TaggedData and/or DelayedData parameters.

This logging function is used 4 times in total in the Job.cpp file. All of the uses are in the run_function, which has if statements that check if a task has read/write constraints. 
* If the task has both constraints then the log function will be called at least once. If tagged data exists the log function will be called with the TaggedData and the log function will always be called with the DelayedData.
* If the task only has the read constraint, then the log function will be called if TaggedData exists.
* If the task only has the write constraint, then the log function will always be called with DelayedData.
* If the task has neither constraint the log function won't be called.

I do realise I went a bit off track with adding new parameters to the log function head, but it was the only way I could think of getting the necessary information that needed to be printed.

## Case 2

The second logging function is called "student_2020_81520_real_cyber_event_logger" and is implemented in Logger.cpp. It takes a time, job ID, and an event name as parameters. Just like in case 1 the function begins by determining if the logfile has been set-up for the current run. If the answer is no, it cleans the file and adds the header. The next step became rather complicated due to the fact that the logging function was not called in the same order as we want the data to be in. For example J11 will write RELEASED, STARTED, and FINISHED at the same time (with different timestamps), while we in reality want to order the writes after their timestamps. To make this possible it was necessary to create a "buffer of writes" like in Logger::start_logging(). I created a struct that would hold the info for a write, and a vector that acted like the buffer. When this vector has more than 25 elements we write the element with the earliest timestamp to the log. The number 25 was chosen since the worst case scenario I could find needed a logged output to be moved around 20 rows backward.

The logging function is used 5 times in the Executor.cpp file, with all uses being in the run_simulation function. The reasoning for their placement is rather straightforward. If a bool representing released, started, or finished is set to true for a job, we also call the log function with the corresponding event. 
* The first two uses are in two different if-statements were if a job gets set to released. Marked with "// Log Job Release" in the code.
* The third use is after the current job has been set to started. Marked with "// Log Job Start" in the code.
* The fourth and fifth uses are after the job has been finished. I added an if statement to determine if the job was finished before the deadline, since we need to differentiate between those two events. Marked with "// Log Job Finish (with missed deadline)" and "// Log Job Finish" in the code.
