The baseline provided had the following characteristics;

#### CC.cpp

‘read2’, which is the target speed, was set to 40 for the baseline.

#### LK.cpp

Knowing what ‘read1’ turned out to be (after some experiments with changing
the values, which I will explain later on in the report), which is _how deviated the
direction of the car is from the center point_ , the baseline assigns the left and right steer
values based on ‘10000’.


# How I changed things

#### Modifying CC.cpp

First, I thought that increasing the speed will solve everything. Thus, I changed
the ‘read2’ value in CC.cpp to _read2 = read2/10_ 0 so that it is 80km/h. However,
the car which simulated fairly for 40km/h crashed into the wall. Thus, I decided
the modifying just the speed was not enough to run the car properly withouts
crashing it.

#### Modifying LK.cpp

Thus, I looked into LK.cpp. Reading the code, and knowing that the w3, w
values are left and right steer values, I changed the inequality boundaries
originally assigned as ‘10000’. Also I change the values assigned to w3 and w4 in
the if conditions similar to the changing boundaries. I realized that as this value
gets smaller, the car steers in large angles only if its direction is heading way off
the center. Thus I concluded that the logic goes like this;

As seen from the drawn picture above, the center of the road is the axis where
angle = 0. When the car’s direction is heading in the blue direction relatively to
the center, the ‘read1’ angle is negative, thus a positive value should be assigned
to the left steer value so that the car can turn as indicated in purple. Similarly
when the car’s direction is heading in the green direction relatively to the center,


the ‘read1’ angle is positive, and a positive value should be assigned to the right
steer call so that the car can turn as indicated in yellow.
I will explain the flow of my modification based on changing the w3 (left steer
value), and the modifications for w4 goes the same for the same reason.
First, I decided that the boundary values ‘10000’ for the inequalities was way
too large. The first inequality when _read1 < -10000_ would mean that this if
statement will be valid when the car is really off in direction from the center. But
I thought that it will be too late to make changes at such extremes, so decreased
the absolute value to 2000, so the if statement is valid when _read1 < -2000_. The
boundary was automatically applied to the other inequality in the other if
statement.
The next question was what values were to be assigned to w3 in each case. The
difference between when _read1 < -2000_ and _-2000 < read1 < 0_ is 1) whether the
car is really heading in the wrong direction, or 2) slightly off the ideal direction.
1) In the first case, I thought that a dramatic change was needed because the
car should quickly come back to the center before it goes any further. Thus,
when _read1 < -200_ 0, I assigned 1600 to w3. This was decided by thinking;
that the value should not go over 2000, because that would mean there is a
change of being directed in the opposite wrong direction, and a few
experiments to find a value that drives the car smoothly on corners.
2) In the second case, I thought that a dramatic change was unnecessary.
Deviating within the range _-2000 < read1 < 0_ would probably be some case
where the car is converging to going straight forward. Thus, I thought that
assigning _read1*(-1)_ was to large, because that might abruptly change the
direction of the car. Thus, I multiplied (-0.5) instead, to make slight changes
little by little.

#### Modifying design.xml

Changing my code to look like the above kept the car from crashing into the
wall at a relatively high speed, but the way the car moved was very
discontinuous, and I had to stay nervous through the whole time until the lap
finished. Seeing how the car changes its direction by and angle when running
the corners every some period, I realized that I needed to modify the period and
execution times of lane keeping. Thus, I changed execution time = 8, and
deadline and period = 200 for LK. This keeps the min(Utilization) = 20 for the
period (100, 250]. By changing this, I expected that the lane keeping task will be
performed more frequently than before, so the car will appear to turn corners
much more smoothly. And my expectation was right!

After all these modifications, I checked that the car simulates with fair stability
up to 110km/h, with lap time of 56 seconds. However, just for safety, I
submitted the CC.cpp file with ‘read2’ parameter as 90km/h, with lap time of 1
minute 7 seconds (because I thought this was enough to get full 10 points). If
there are additional scores for coming in earlier, then please test my simulation
with 110km/h.
